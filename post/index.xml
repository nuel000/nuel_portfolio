Specifically focusing on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment and finally we will uncover trends and patterns by answering questions such as;
What are the characteristics associated with patients who do not shop up for their appointments? What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?</description>

In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.</description>
